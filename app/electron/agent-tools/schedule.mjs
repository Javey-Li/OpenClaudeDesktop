// CronCreate / CronList / CronDelete: Claude Code's session scheduler (electron/schedule-service.cjs) for a core
// without its own. Kimi, Qwen and MiMo schedule prompts themselves, so their descriptors list CronCreate in
// nativeTools and get none of these. (ZCode has Cron* tools too, but they need a host automation service Code Desktop
// doesn't run, so the zcode bridge withholds them and ZCode gets these.) A fired prompt reaches the session as a new turn once it is idle, with the
// session's own Mode, so it never runs with more access than the session has.
//
// Creating a job asks the user first (the session's approval card; Bypass permissions creates it without asking):
// a scheduled prompt starts turns on its own later.
// ctx.schedules: { create({cron, prompt, recurring}) → job, list() → [job], remove(id) → boolean }  (main.cjs)

const CREATE_DESCRIPTION = `Schedule a prompt to be enqueued at a future time in this session. Use for both recurring schedules and one-shot reminders.
Uses standard 5-field cron in the user's local timezone: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week. "0 9 * * *" means 9am local — no timezone conversion needed.
## One-shot tasks (recurring: false)
For "remind me at X" or "at <time>, do Y" requests — fire once then auto-delete. Pin minute/hour/day-of-month/month to specific values:
  "remind me at 2:30pm today to check the deploy" → cron: "30 14 <today_dom> <today_month> *", recurring: false
## Recurring jobs (recurring: true, the default)
For "every N minutes" / "every hour" / "weekdays at 9am" requests: "*/5 * * * *" (every 5 min), "0 * * * *" (hourly), "0 9 * * 1-5" (weekdays at 9am local).
## Avoid the :00 and :30 minute marks when the task allows it
When the user's request is approximate, pick a minute that is not 0 or 30 ("every morning around 9" → "57 8 * * *"; "hourly" → "7 * * * *"). Only use minute 0 or 30 when the user names that exact time.
## Not for live watching
To watch a log file, process or command output and be told the moment something changes, use Monitor instead — cron re-runs a prompt at fixed wall-clock intervals.
## Runtime behavior
The user approves the schedule first. Jobs only fire while this session is idle (not mid-turn), and only while Code Desktop is running: they are session-only and gone when the app quits (durable has no effect). Recurring tasks auto-expire after ${EXPIRY_DAYS} days — they fire one final time, then are deleted. Tell the user about the ${EXPIRY_DAYS}-day limit when scheduling recurring jobs.
Returns a job ID you can pass to CronDelete.`;
