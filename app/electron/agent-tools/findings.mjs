// ReportFindings: Claude Code's tool for reporting code-review findings as a typed list, so the app can show them as
// review results (the transcript's Review result card and the Changes pane's findings bar, src/review-findings-model.mjs
// reportedFindings) instead of prose. Re-reporting after fixes sets each finding's outcome. Qwen Code has its own
// report_findings (the bridge projects it to the same card), so it lists ReportFindings in nativeTools.
// No side effects: the call only records what the agent found.
