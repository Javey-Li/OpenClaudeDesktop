// The hidden reminders a turn carries for dynamic workflows (Claude Code 2.1.280): the "ultracode" keyword, ultracode
// mode on / still on / off, and the size guideline. Kept apart from workflow-tool-model.mjs (which loads the workflow
// script parser) so turn/start never waits for that. Main-process only.
//
// On Code Desktop's engine they name its Workflow tool and point at the Ultracode section of that tool's description
// (Claude points at its authoring-reference skill, which Code Desktop doesn't ship). On a core's own engine (Settings ›
// Dynamic workflows › Workflow engine: the agent's) that tool doesn't exist: they name the core's own workflow tool
// (descriptor workflowTool {name, skill?}) and carry the ultracode guidance themselves.
