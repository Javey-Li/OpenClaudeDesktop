// The code_desktop MCP server's instructions (agent-tools-server.mjs sends them in its initialize reply). The
// verification workflow is Claude Desktop's auto-verify (2.2553.1 <preview_tools> <verification_workflow>, on while
// .claude/launch.json leaves top-level "autoVerify" unset or true), in Code Desktop's tool names; the Preview pane's
// Servers & settings › Enable / Disable auto verify writes that key.
//
// Not every core hands an MCP server's instructions to its model (ZCode's MCP adapter drops them), so the agent-tools
// host also puts the text in the server definition it gives bridges (CODE_DESKTOP_AGENT_TOOLS_SERVER "instructions"),
// and such a bridge adds it to the instructions it already sends.
