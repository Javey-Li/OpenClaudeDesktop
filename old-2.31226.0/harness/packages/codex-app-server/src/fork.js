/**
 * thread/fork → a Harness fork: a new ordinary session seeded with an exact
 * inclusive event prefix of the source (dsh-session `buildForkSeed`), as the
 * DeepSeek app's own fork does (dsh-api-session-controller `fork`). The new
 * session's header names the source as `parentSession` (a fork, not a
 * sub-agent), so its Thread carries `forkedFromId` (subagents.js) and shows
 * the history it copied.
 *
 * The cut follows Codex ThreadForkParams: `lastTurnId` forks through that turn
 * (it cannot be in progress), `beforeTurnId` forks through the turn before it,
 * neither forks through the latest completed turn. A turn ends at its
 * `turn/end` (a manual compaction's at its `compaction/end`, projection.js
 * endSeq); the cut then takes the events that still belong to it, up to the
 * next turn, prompt, inbox splice or manual compaction (upstream's
 * latestCompletedPrefixBoundary, which also stops at a manual compaction so a
 * later compaction turn is not carried into the fork).
 *
